Welcome to the National Math Camp portal! This website is dedicated to hosting the front-facing material at the annual **Bangladesh National Math Camp**, or NMC, although I just made that abbreviation up.

NMC is an 10-12 days residential camp held in Dhaka every year after the [BdMO](https://matholympiad.org.bd) nationals with the primary goal of IMO team selection. However, NMC is hardly only about math! This website hosts images, write-ups, and other fun stuff that happens each year at NMC.
